A terribly coded discord bot which allows users to submit a schedule indicating the times at which they are busy.
The bot mentions any users who are not busy on command.
This was made with the intention of being used for students attending the University of Toronto.
I threw it together in one night and it was pretty terrible. I continued to work on it and now it's less terrible but still terrible.
Enjoy!
